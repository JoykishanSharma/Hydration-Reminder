# Hydration Reminder

## Problem :
#### Have you ever got so indulge in coding that "Next Feature", that you don't realize, you have been sitting there for almost 3-4 hours straight and haven't drink a single drop of water, although the water bottle was in front of you, this whole time.

#### Well, this has happened with me a lot of time. This might seem "not that of a big deal" problem, but this is a big problem in long run. We human, are waking animals, we are not meant to just seat down at a chair and type-type-type.

#### To solve this problem, i have a simple and naive solution. It's a ugly work at best. It has helped me till date. And I think, It can help you too.  

## Solution : 
#### A Hydration Reminder that will remind you every hour to take a break and get hydrated (drink water). 

## How it works :
#### Basically there is a python script that runs in background that reminds every hour with a MessageBox to take a break and get hydrated. As simple as that. You don't need to install any reminder software. You don't need to give any administrator privileges.

## How to set this up and running :
> You need to have Python3 installed on your system.
1. Download the above "OneHourTimer.pyw" file.
2. Place this file in your "Startup" folder(Win+R -> "shell:startup" -> Enter).
3. Done.
> Next Time you start your windows machine, this python script will automatically start executing.

## That's it folks. Hope this helps.
